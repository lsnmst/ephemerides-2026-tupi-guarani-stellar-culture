# Ephemerides 2026 - Tupi-Guarani Stellar Culture Visualization

This Python script generates a multi-night sky-dome animation of the 2026 ephemerides, visualizing the stars according to the **Tupi-Guarani astronomical culture**, compiled by the **Seichú Astronomical Observatory**, located in the **Parque Arqueológico da Pedra do Sol**, Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais, Brazil.
The visualization highlights stars, their trajectories across the night sky, and constellation imagery with culturally significant names and symbols.
